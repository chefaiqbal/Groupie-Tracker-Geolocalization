# Groupie Tracker Geolocalization

## Objectives

Groupie Tracker Geolocalization aims to implement the same principles as the first subject. This project's primary objective is as follows:

- **Mapping Concert Locations**: This project focuses on mapping the different concert locations of a certain artist or band provided by the Client. It involves the process of converting addresses (e.g., "Germany Mainz") into geographic coordinates (e.g., "49.59380, 8.15052"). These coordinates are used to place markers on a map, visualizing the concert locations of the chosen artist or band.
